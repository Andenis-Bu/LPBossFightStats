[c/ff9eb4:LP's Boss Fight Stats]
LP's Boss Fight Stats is a mod for Terraria that enhances the boss fight experience by tracking and displaying various statistics after the battle. This mod provides detailed summaries of you and your friends performance, helping you to improve your strategies and enjoy a more competitive gameplay experience.

[c/ff9eb4:Important Notes]
• [c/f5ffc7:Multiplayer Only:] This mod is meant to be used in multiplayer only. In single-player mode, it won't show any statistics.
• [c/f5ffc7:Chat-Based Display:] Currently, the mod displays the statistics in chat after the boss fight ends. Alongside potential bug fixes, the next big step for this mod is to add an actual GUI for a more user-friendly experience.
• [c/f5ffc7:Chat Scrolling:] You can scroll through the chat history using the up and down arrow keys to ensure you don't miss any important statistics.
